### 👋 Hey there, I'm Shreyas!

I'm a Data geek(not literally, but yeah) who knows their way around Power BI, SQL, Databricks & Python — and around a bar counter too 🍻.  
With 2+ years of experience turning messy data into meaningful insights, I thrive in greenfield environments where every day brings something new (preferably not on fire).

Currently on the lookout for new opportunities where I can keep learning, keep building, and maybe even keep caffeinating responsibly ☕.

### 🧠 About Me:

- 🔭 **Currently looking for:**  
  Exciting roles in cloud-native data engineering and analytics. Bonus points if the team likes memes.

- 👯 **Would love to collaborate on:**  
  Building data pipelines, Azure cloud projects, or anything where data gets a much-needed glow-up.

- 🤝 **Could use help with:**  
  Best practices in cloud data architecture, and contributing to open-source data projects without accidentally breaking things.

- 🌱 **Currently learning:**  
  How to orchestrate data like a maestro 🎻 — diving into Azure Synapse, Data Factory, Delta Lake, and better CI/CD workflows.

- 💬 **Ask me about:**  
  Power BI dashboards, SQL optimization tricks, fixing broken ETL pipelines, Databricks chaos management, or how to serve 50 cocktails in one night without crying.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I once handled revenue-critical data for Coca-Cola by day and mixed mojitos by night. Career highlight: no spills in either field (mostly).
